MoveIt Task Constructor (MTC)
=============================

The Task Constructor framework provides a flexible and transparent way
to define and plan actions that consist of multiple interdependent subtasks.
It draws on the planning capabilities of MoveIt to solve individual subproblems
in black-box planning stages.
A common interface, based on MoveItâ€™s PlanningScene is used to pass solution
hypotheses between stages. The framework enables the hierarchical organization of
basic stages using containers, allowing for sequential as well as parallel compositions.
